## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup

###  Backend (Flask)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start the Flask server:
   python app.py


Frontend (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the React app:
   npm start


How It Works:
User submits form with career goal, degree, major, credit status, and availability

React sends the data to the Flask API

Flask filters relevant courses and generates a prompt

Mistral (via Ollama) returns recommended courses

The frontend displays them with reasoning and schedule info


To run the LLM locally:
  ollama run mistral
