This course will include three major components (1) physical board game design, (2) introductory computer game design and (3) investigation into the narrative themes, artistic production, interaction mechanics and culture that make games engaging. During the course, students will prototype both playable board and video games, followed by iterating through to a final version of a game of their choice. Class will meet in the CU Community Fab Lab in Art Annex II. Students who have taken a different makerspace class before are encouraged to enroll. Additional fees may apply. See Class Schedule. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.

Makerspace: Escape Rooms,"This course will explore the intersection of storytelling, interaction design, and user experience through the design of escape rooms. In the past couple years escape rooms have been on the rise, changing from simple locked boxes in an open room to complex adventures spanning multiple rooms involving electronics, sound design, storytelling, and even live actors. This class will be primarily focusing on the manufacturing and electronics work that goes into making an immersive escape room experience. Over the span of the course, students will become familiar with the basics of several advanced small-scale manufacturing tools, such as laser engravers, electronic cutters, and 3D printers/scanners. They will also learn how to program small-board electronics (Arduinos and IoT boards, servos, electronic locks, and/or lights), and incorporate them meaningfully into puzzles in order to achieve client’s goals. Students will design, prototype, playtest, and iterate collaboratively on the puzzles and interactive elements. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.

Lastly, we will discuss deep neural networks and other methods at the forefront of machine learning. We situate the course components in the ""data science life cycle"" as part of the larger set of practices in the discovery and communication of scientific findings. The course will include lectures, readings, homework assignments, exams, and a class project. Most of the course activities will use Python with the Pandas library, which students should already be proficient using. Students will learn how to use the scikit-learn Python library for machine learning during this course.

Marketing in Our New Digital World,"Offers a strategic perspective and examination on how the digital revolution is changing the marketing landscape. We will explore this new digital realm and discuss its revolutionary impact upon both firms and consumers. This exploration comes in two parts. In the first part (the first four weeks), we will explore how the digital revolution has affected our analog (or physical) world. Specifically, we will examine four ways in which the Analog World has been affected by the Digital Revolution: Domination, Resistance, Synergy, and Transformation. In the second part (the second four weeks), we will review the foundations of marketing (i.e., product, promotion, placement, and price) and examine how these foundations are being shifted by the rise of the digital revolution. In this portion of the course, we will explore a variety of new digital concepts and tools, including, customer co-creation, user-generated content, and 3D printing. This course will contain several examples of each of these concepts and explore their implications for both marketers and consumers. This course will also employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises, and interviews with leading marketing scholars. The learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and be a member of a rich learning community. I hope you will join us in this educational adventure. Please note that this is not an e-commerce class. We will not examine social media analytics, search engine optimization, or other digital marketing tactics.
